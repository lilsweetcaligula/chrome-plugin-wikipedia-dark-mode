## Description

This is a very basic dark mode for Wikipedia Chrome extension that I wrote
for personal use.


## Installation

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and enable "Developer mode".
Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder with this repo.


## Notes

Currently, the plugin only works for the English Wikipedia. Maybe later I'll
go back and extend this plugin to something worthy of the Chrome Store. But
probably not.
